# MNIST-Binary-Classification
Tensorflow Binary Classification using Sigmoid. Oversampling and Undersampling to balance dataset and improve accuracy.

Oversampling: Increase the number of instances in the minority class (sneaker class) by duplicating or generating synthetic samples.
Undersampling: Decrease the number of instances in the majority class (non-sneaker class) by randomly removing samples until both classes have approximately the same number of instances.
